# Mission-to-Mars
This is the creation of a web page used to scrape information about Mars from other web pages using Splinter and BeautifulSoup. All data is stored in a Mongo database called mars_app. The web page has a button that the user can 'scrape new data' and get the most current item in the list below. The web page will display the following:

- The most current news article from www.redplanetscience.com
- The featured image from www.spaceimages-mars.com
- A table of Mars vs Earth facts from www.galaxyfacts-mars.com
- Images of the Mars Hemispheres taken from www.marshemispheres.com
